This archive contains the aerodynamic data for the NACA airfoils contained 
in NACA TR 824 in text form (i.e. x and y coordinates for the Cm, Cl and Cd
data as "illustrated" in NACA Report TR-824. TR-824 is the basis of the 
textbook, THEORY OF WING SECTIONS by Abott and Von Doenhoff. TR-824 is 
readily availble in the public domain. Find the NACA servers and search!! 
(I believe it also available off the X-plane registry) 

This archive was generated by Gregory P.D. Siemens in 1994 when he was at 
Uinversity of Saskatchewan (Go Huskies Go!), Canada and is the property of 
the Public Domain.

Hope some enterprising individual can make good use of it for X-Plane and 
by placing it in the registry, it continues to be readily avaibale to live 
a long digital life.

Notes:
 
1.	The individual files for each airfoil are catalogued by xxx.all. The 
NACA.lst file can be opened in wordpad and then used to find the data file 
for the desired airfoil from TR-824. Some graphs were omitted because the 
dealt strictly with multi-element wings (flaps and such) but all of the 
others are in there. The file naca.lst cross-references the files to the 
airfoils.

2.	The format of the data is as follows:

A.  The first section (ranges 1-6) is two column data of Angle-of-Attack 
(AoA) vs Cl.  There is potential for 6 Reynold's number ranges (approx. 
3x10^6, 6x10^6, 9x10^6, 6x10^6 @ standard roughness and two ranges with a 
simple split flap);

B.  The second section (ranges 7-12)contains AoA vs Cm for the above 
Reynold's numbers;

C.  The third section (ranges 1-6) contains Cl vs Cd data for the same 
Reynold's number ranges;

D.  The fourth section (ranges 7-12) contains Cl vs Cm data for the same 
Reynold's numbers; and

E.  The fifth section contains three column data of AoA, Cl and 
Cd(interpolated).

3.	Since not all Reynold's number ranges were plotted for all airfoils not 
all ranges will be present.  These ranges will be listed as "Data Range x does 
not exist".  Another peculiarity of the fourth section is the large number of 
data that is = 0.  This is a result of the way the Cd(int.) was calculated.  
Each angle of attack, Cl pair was taken and a Cd value was interpolated from 
the Cl, Cd graph to correspond to that Cl value.  For some reason known only 
to NACA for high values of Cl the corresponding value of Cd was ommitted.  
This is mainly due to the constant scale used across all of the graphs in 
TR 824.  If the Cd value fell off the graph, the graph was not changed to 
accomodate it. When A high value of Cl is encountered no Cd can be 
interpolated and thus the gaps in the data.  In case you are wondering if 
extrapolation could have been used, a quick glance at the Cl,Cd graph 
(v. high slopes) or at a plot of angle of attack vs Cd(int.) (local maximums 
occur inside the gaps) shows the folly of that technique in this case.

4.	Use wordpad or notepad to open up the .all, .lst files.
