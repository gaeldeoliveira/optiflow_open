NACA 23015
Combines a 230 mean line with a 0015 thickness (four digit). 
The first digit, 2, means the mean line has a design lift coeff=0.3
The second digit, 3, means the max camber is at 15% chord
The third digit, 0, meand the mean line is non-reflexed
The fourth and fifth digits, 12, mean the max. thickness is 0.12 chord
