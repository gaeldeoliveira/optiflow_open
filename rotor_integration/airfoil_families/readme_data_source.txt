Data source: FFA airfoil polars estimated from FFA airfoil coordinates with Rfoil. Coordinates removed from repository before going open source. The following files were removed:




This is deemed to be consistent with common practice in wind energy community (e.g. public HAWC-2 example files include FFA airfoil polar estimations). TU-Delft had access and right to use those files from
